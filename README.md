Hello and thank you for checking out myOverlay. 

Feel free reach out to me directly on G+: https://plus.google.com/+DavidFunes/posts

myOverlay is an attempt to help streamline the absorption of information by connecting YouTube and the Chrome browser to the sites that people love to visit.

The goal is to have an extension that will provide a video pop up related to the content that the user is currently viewing, and to provide this popup video on demand.

For Example: You are looking up information about 'John Wilks Booth' and you find a nice wiki about it. The wiki is crazy long and you would rather not read it. Fortunatly, there are plenty of YouTube videos that talk about who Johnny Booth is! By activating myOverlay, a video would popup relevant to the informations you are currently viewing.

By pulling metadata from the current URL, myOverlay can query the YouTube database for a video that is most relevant to your current page. Cross referenceing this with a database of youtube videos that have been viewed before, myOverlay would choose the best video for you to view. The 'best' video would be determined by the community of myOverlay users through a series of voting algorithms. The UI would allow users to rate their experience and suggest better videos.

  I decided to create this readme. I am in need of funding and developers in order to continue this project. If you are interested in helping, please let me know.
  
  Currently I am able to get the viewer to show a video based on the URL if it matched 1 or 2 specific URL's. 
  
  Still looking for people familiar with :  
    Creating Databases
    Working with the YouTube API
    Working with the Chrom Extension URL 
    Parsing
    Voting Alhorithms
    Permissions (omg please permissions)
    
This is my first open source project, so I am also looking for any advice about how to do any of this right. 

Thanks!
-Dave
